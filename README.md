# NetPractice

## Description

NetPractice is a 42 School project designed to teach the fundamentals of computer networking through a series of interactive configuration exercises. Each level presents a broken network topology where IP addresses, subnet masks, default gateways, and routing tables must be corrected. The goal is to analyze the network, identify configuration errors, and apply proper networking rules so that all communication paths become valid.

## Instructions

NetPractice runs entirely in a browser. No compilation or installation is required. Open the file `index.html` in a browser to start the training interface.  

The project contains 10 levels. In each level, a network topology may contain incorrect IP addresses, subnet masks, default gateways, or routing table entries. Your task is to analyze the network, identify configuration errors, and correct them until all communication paths are valid and all indicators turn green.  

After completing a level, click the **“Get My Config”** button. A JSON file containing your configuration will be generated automatically. Save each file using the following naming format:  

 Levelx.json



Make sure all 10 JSON files are placed in the root directory of your repository along with the README.md file. This ensures that your submission can be properly verified.

## Resources

This project involves studying and applying essential networking concepts, including:

- TCP/IP addressing  
- Subnet masks and CIDR notation (/24, /27, /28, etc.)  
- Network and broadcast addresses  
- Default gateways  
- Routers and switches behavior  
- Routing tables  
- Forward and reverse communication paths  
- Overlapping subnets  
- OSI layers (especially Layer 3 – Network layer)

## AI Usage Disclosure

AI assistance (ChatGPT) was used for:

- Structuring and formatting this README.md  
- Clarifying networking concepts such as subnetting, masks, and routing logic  
- Summarizing resources and topics covered  

AI was **not** used to generate or modify the exported JSON configuration files. All network solutions were created manually by analyzing each level.
